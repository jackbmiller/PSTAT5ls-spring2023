# Lab Assignment

## Question 1

:::{.question}
We're going to start by playing a bit with R Markdown. Read carefully through the text below and apply formatting to it as follows:

1. Make the text below that says "Tips and Tricks for R Markdown" bold.
2. Make the text below that says "Knit and knit often" italic.
3. Make the text below that says "Make sure your chunk syntax is correct" italic.
4. Make the text below that says "Be persistent!" bold.

Tips and Tricks for R Markdown

1. Knit and knit often. You'll be turning in the knitted HTML document to Canvas for grading, and it's important that you know what it looks like!
2. Make sure your chunk syntax is correct. You should only have one set of opening and closing backticks (```) per chunk!
3. Be persistent! Learning this system takes time, and it's okay if you don't get it right away. Just keep trying, and don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Question 2

:::{.question}
In the chunk below, import ("read in") the data in `a2trees_clean.csv` and call it `a2trees`. 
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r question2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).
gyur652edtye46edty <- read.csv("t768r47irfuytr57rf.csv")
```

:::

## Question 3
:::{.question}
Use a function to see what the `a2trees` data look like. Then, list out the categorical and numeric variables.
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r question3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

The categorical variables in the data are: 

The numeric variables in the data are: 

:::

## Question 4

:::{.question}
Use R as a calculator to compute the following values. Assign the first value the name `x`, the second value the name `y`, and the third `z`.
$$\frac{27}{2 + 3^2}$$
$$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} \times 0.257$$
$$92^3 - 734$$
:::


:::{.answer}
```{r question4, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).






```

```{r question4Answers, error = T, collapse = T}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK: it's how we'll check your work. YOUR ANSWERS GO IN THE CHUNK ABOVE THIS ONE.

### Submission instructions
<!-- This is a comment and will not show up in your document. Note that the
numbering here is all 1's. This will automatically be converted to 1, 2, etc.
