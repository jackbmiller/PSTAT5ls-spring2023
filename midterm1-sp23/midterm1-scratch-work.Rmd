# Code

Use the chunks below for any code you need for Midterm 1. Be sure you run the setup chunk first, before you try any code. **Note:** We will not be grading anything in your midterm1-sp23 project, so be sure to copy everything you need over to the exam itself. 

```{r setup, error = T}
library(stats250sbi)
```

```{r tryIt1, error = T}

```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}

```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}

```

```{r tryIt4, error = T}

```

```{r tryIt5, error = T}

```

```{r tryIt6, error = T}

```
